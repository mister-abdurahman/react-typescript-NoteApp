We use BrowserRouter (from react-router-dom) in the main, and route&routes in components to configure routing in react.

We specified routes for different views and also set any unset route to home.

my-4: bootstrap. margin-top & bottom

We used the react-select library for the tag select functionality

Link from react-router is used to move from one page to another like moving back one step to our previous page

We'r using ref so that we can go to our form and to make sure that our form actually does something. So the values inside our form.control for both title and textarea are being stored in the jsx ref attribute and automatically replaces the default set.

Apparently 'FormEvent' is a thing and its from react too

In CreatableReactSelect, onChange gets direct access to value in its call back fn.

Data passed inside a react element can be referred to as children and can be accessed as such from other components

To understand typescript with react, use the approach of: components are templates created to be used on their own or elsewhere, and they are made by preparing them for whatever data they would be accepting by setting data types where necessary and generics where we arent sure of the data format.

For a generic to work, you need to mention what the data would be at some point (or not if we're calling it in another component, honestly it all depends.)
